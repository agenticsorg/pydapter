# Research Clarifications for External Researchers

## Question 1: Protocol-Field Coupling Patterns in Domain-Driven Design

**Scope Clarification:**

1. **Framework Focus**: Prioritize **server-side application frameworks** (Django, Spring, .NET Core, FastAPI, Express.js) as these are most relevant to our data adapter use case. Include 2-3 frontend frameworks (React Hook Form, Vue.js composition API) for contrast but not as primary focus.

2. **Language Diversity**: Yes, include **2-3 functional/statically typed languages** (Haskell's type classes, Rust's traits, F#'s interfaces) as they often have cleaner patterns for protocol-structure coupling that we can adapt to Python.

3. **Framework Priority**: Focus on **industry-grade enterprise frameworks** (80%) with 1-2 academic/experimental examples (20%) for innovative approaches. We need battle-tested patterns more than theoretical elegance.

**Additional Context**: We're particularly interested in how frameworks handle protocol composition (e.g., combining Identifiable + Temporal + Auditable protocols) and whether they use compile-time or runtime field resolution.

## Question 2: Progressive Complexity APIs in Developer Tools

**Audience and Scope:**

1. **Target Audience**: Primary focus on **intermediate Python developers** (3-5 years experience) who understand OOP but may not be familiar with advanced metaprogramming. Secondary consideration for novices and experts.

2. **Library Types**: Prioritize **data modeling and IO libraries** (Pydantic, SQLAlchemy, Prisma, FastAPI, marshmallow) as primary focus. Include UI/dataflow libraries (React Hook Form, Vue Composition API) for progressive disclosure patterns but not implementation details.

3. **API Structure**: We have initial concepts but want your recommendations. Current thinking:
   ```python
   # Tier 1: Simple presets
   create_entity(), create_event(), create_document()
   
   # Tier 2: Protocol-based  
   create_model(Identifiable, Temporal, **fields)
   
   # Tier 3: Full control
   DomainModelBuilder().with_protocol().with_field().build()
   ```

**Key Question**: How do successful libraries handle the transition between tiers without making users feel like they need to "start over"?

## Question 3: Microservice Data Model Patterns and Schema Evolution

**Technical Priorities:**

1. **Serialization Formats**: Priority order:
   - **JSON** (highest priority - REST APIs, web services)
   - **Protocol Buffers** (high priority - gRPC, high-performance services)  
   - **Avro** (medium priority - event streaming, Kafka)
   - **MessagePack, Thrift** (lower priority)

2. **Transport Mechanisms**: Include all major patterns:
   - **REST APIs** (highest priority)
   - **gRPC** (high priority)
   - **Message queues** (high priority - Kafka, RabbitMQ, cloud queues)
   - **GraphQL** (medium priority)

3. **Focus Areas**: Equal emphasis on:
   - **Schema definition patterns** (how to structure field templates)
   - **Schema evolution tooling** (versioning, compatibility checks)
   - **Runtime validation/conversion** (field template adaptability)

**Key Interest**: How to design field templates that can generate appropriate schemas for different serialization formats without duplicating definitions.

## Question 4: Type System Design for Configuration-Heavy Libraries

**Language and Implementation Focus:**

1. **Language Scope**: 
   - **Python** (70% of research) - our primary implementation language
   - **TypeScript** (20%) - excellent type system patterns we can adapt
   - **Rust, C#** (10%) - for contrasting approaches and inspiration

2. **IDE vs Runtime**: **IDE support and static analysis** is higher priority. We want developers to get good autocomplete, type checking, and refactoring support even with dynamically created models.

3. **System Types**: Focus on **enterprise systems** that need to balance developer productivity with maintainability. Include 1-2 experimental approaches if they show promise for enterprise adoption.

**Specific Interest**: How libraries maintain typing information through metaprogramming layers and what patterns enable good IDE integration.

## Question 5: Adapter Pattern Implementation in Data Access Libraries

**Adapter Priorities and Patterns:**

1. **Adapter Targets** (priority order):
   - **Relational databases** (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite) - highest priority
   - **NoSQL stores** (MongoDB, Redis, DynamoDB) - high priority
   - **Search engines** (Elasticsearch, OpenSearch) - high priority
   - **REST APIs** - medium priority
   - **Message queues** - medium priority

2. **Configuration Style**: Focus on **static declaration** with runtime selection. We want schemas defined at development time but adapter choice made at runtime through configuration.

3. **Ecosystem Integration**: Prioritize:
   - **SQLAlchemy plugin patterns** (highest - we build on SQLAlchemy)
   - **FastAPI dependency injection** (high - common usage pattern)
   - **Cloud-native backends** (medium - growing importance)

**Key Question**: How to embed adapter-specific hints (indexes, constraints, optimization hints) in field templates without coupling to specific adapters.

## Question 6: Performance Implications of Metaprogramming in Python Data Libraries

**Performance Focus Areas:**

1. **Current Bottlenecks**: We've observed:
   - **Cold start latency** when dynamically creating many models
   - **Memory usage** from template instances vs generated types
   - **Import time** when registering many protocols/field families

2. **Performance Priorities**:
   - **Runtime performance** (70%) - field access, validation, serialization
   - **Build-time/model creation** (30%) - acceptable to be slower at startup

3. **Implementation Constraints**: 
   - **Pure Python preferred** but open to Cython/Rust extensions if significant gains
   - Must maintain compatibility with standard Python typing tools

4. **Type Checking**: Include **mypy performance impacts** - this affects developer experience significantly.

**Specific Interest**: Caching strategies for generated types and whether template-based approaches have better memory characteristics than instance-based ones.

## Additional Guidance for All Questions

**Research Priorities:**
1. **Concrete code examples** over theoretical discussion
2. **Performance numbers** where available (even if approximate)
3. **Migration stories** - how libraries evolved their APIs
4. **Common pitfalls** - what doesn't work and why

**Cross-Cutting Themes:**
- How patterns from one domain (e.g., frontend progressive APIs) apply to data libraries
- Whether metaprogramming patterns from one library work well in others
- How the Python ecosystem's evolution (typing, performance) affects these patterns

**Deliverable Format:**
- Start each report with a 1-page executive summary
- Include code examples for key patterns
- End with 3-5 specific recommendations for our use case
- Note any contradictions or trade-offs between different approaches

Thank you for taking the time to clarify these details. These focus areas will ensure the research directly supports our architectural decisions.
